# AIM MIL-STD-1553 Custom Device

The **AIM MIL-STD-1553 Custom Device** allows use of [AIM MIL-STD-1553 PXIe Modules](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.aim-mil-std-1553.html) in VeriStand. The custom device targets one **BIU** (Bus Interface Unit) of an AIM MIL-STD-1553 PXIe module. To target multiple modules or multiple BIUs on the same module, use multiple instances of this custom device.

The custom device supports the following functionality:
- Import configuration files via scripting and System Explorer
- LabVIEW scripting of the custom device configuration
- Viewing read-only configuration in System Explorer
- Transmit and Receive configured messages, command words, and status words
   - Scheduled and Acyclic
   - Multiple parameters per message
   - Multiple messages per BIU
   - Log all messages per BIU
